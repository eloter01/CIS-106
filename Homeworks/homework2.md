## Part 1

1. What are the advantages of open source?

From my understanding, one advantage is that open source allows for innovation and transparency in the software creation process. This can lead to superior code because any individual's talent can contribute to making it better. Even in the presence of proprietary software, open source allows many developers to try their hand at creating an innovative and superior product. Another advantage is that open source gives the user the ability to be in control of what software they run by giving them access to the entirety of the code. They need not be bothered with getting permission or worry about being sanctioned for using the code in the way they best see fit. Also, open source code tends to be free, which adds a monetary incentive for its use in the form of savings. The collaborative aspect of open source is another major advantage. Many people in the software engineering and coding fields naturally enjoy working on open source software that is valuable to them. This can to communities of support, improvements, and fixes in relatively short periods of time. 

2. What are the basic freedoms that make a software open source?

They are to inspect, modify, copy and use the software in almost anyway they choose, without licensing restrictions.


3. Why do you think people should use the free software/open-source alternative instead of the proprietary version?

Using free software/open-source could motivate the owners of proprietary software to improve their transparency and relax licensing restrictions to a more reasonable level. It may also move them to include more open-source projects. In practice, though, I believe that people should use the software that best suits their needs, be it proprietary or free/open-source. There are good software options of both types. In my case, I like playing PC games and unfortunately the best titles are not open-source/free.


4. Watch the following video: Why is free software important? Richard Stallman - in INT's ENLIGHTENMENT MINUTES. Do you agree with Richard Stallman? Do you disagree? Explain your answer.

I disagree that non-free software has power over their uses to the degree that Stallman argues. But I do agree that having more control over software would benefit the user. That is essentially true by definition. It appears that Stallman is making the additional argument that no reasonable person would ever agree to the arrangement given by proprietary software and that no good circumstances could exist for that. I'm not sure I buy that, but that could be because I'm not terribly familiar with the software engineering world. I tend to think of things in terms of intellectual property and look into framing the debate in that context. I have more to learn.
