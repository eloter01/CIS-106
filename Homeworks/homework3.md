This distro supports installation from live medium and has a medium file size (< 2GB). As long as Mario's laptop is of the architecture supported, then this is a viable distro. Moreover, there appear to be plenty of tutorial online about how to create a bootable system from USB drive.

## Scenario 2: Using Linux for parental control

This Ubuntu distro is specially tailored to the needs of young students. It also includes Gnome Nanny which has parental controls. According to their website, their minimum requirements are:

* Processor: of 1ghz or above
* Memory: 512MB of RAM (1GB recommended)
* Disk: 20GB of disk space depending on options
* Graphics: If you plan to use the netbook interface, you will require a graphics card that supports 3D acceleration on Ubuntu. 

Arguably, these specs are probably available in an older laptop. $150 would be enough for some Linux-based educational software for children and external memory, if needed.

## Scenario 3: Linux + Gaming

This distro is billed as a gaming distro. It supports the latest gaming hardware for laptops and comes preloaded with important gaming related applications like Steam. It also has an adjusted framerate tuned for gaming and also supports XBox and PlayStation controllers.

## Scenario 4: Reviving an old PC
