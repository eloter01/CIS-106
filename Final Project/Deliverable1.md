# Final Project | Deliverable 1

## Questions to Answer


**1. Which project will you be completing?**

I will be setting up a Samba file server.


**2. Why have you chosen this project?**

As a data scientist or engineer in training, it would be very useful to understand how to set up a personal server for several reasons. I may want to set up a data science laboratory with large data sets to work on and have the ability to access it regardless of the platform, for example. I have read that compatibility is one of the strengths of Samba. While file servers have their limitations, I like to build up from the basics and this looks like a good place to start.


**3. What are the possible problems, roadblocks, or difficulties you anticipate during the process of completing the project?**

I will have to see what documentation and support is available for setting up the Samba file server. I will have to understand how to set up the system along with the many options that I am sure come with it. Also, there may be basic networking terminology and concepts that I am unfamiliar with.


**4. How are you planning to overcome these difficulties?**

From a quick search online, it looks like there is plenty of support and tutorials for the project. I will make sure to do the research to learn any background material I may need. If I get really stuck, I will ask the Professor for assistance.


**5. How do you think completing this project will help you in your career?**

This project will be hands on practice in a practical aspect of doing data science. I am sure I will be working with data servers a lot, certainly in the beginning, and I could extend this to learning about handling large data files. I also want practice in documentation and instruction for these kinds of projects, and having an online presence with these kinds of outreach to the data science community seems to enhance their careers.
