## Final Project | Deliverable 2

### Resources being used: 

    * Samba website and documentation 

    * Ubuntu website and documentation 

    * Articles and tutorials on third-party websites 

    * Canva for creating any graphics I will use 

### Technologies that I am learning: 

    * Basic networking in Ubuntu 

    * File servers in Ubuntu 

    * Relevant Linux commands

These resources will supply background in the technologies used in setting up a Samba file server in Linux. The documentation is often the best place to check first, followed by third-party resources. First, I will understand the basic terminology and concepts in local are networking. Then I will learn what a file server is, how Samba is used for this purpose, and how to set one up in a personal installation of Ubuntu.
